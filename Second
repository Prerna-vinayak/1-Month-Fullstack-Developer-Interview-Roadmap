Python: Dictionary, List comprehension, Functions (*args, **kwargs)

DSA: Two sum problem, Max/Min in array

SQL: GROUP BY, COUNT, SUM

Python 
1. Dictionary

Definition: A dictionary in Python is a collection of keyâ€“value pairs, where each key is unique.
Example:

students = {"Prerna": 85, "Rahul": 92, "Aditi": 78, "Rohit": 90}

# Find topper
topper = max(students, key=students.get)
print("Topper:", topper, "Marks:", students[topper])


âœ… Explanation: Here, names are keys and marks are values; max(..., key=students.get) finds the student with highest marks.

2. List Comprehension

Definition: A concise way to create new lists from existing iterables in a single line.
Example:

numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
evens = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]
print(evens)


âœ… Explanation: [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0] generates a new list containing only even numbers.

3. Functions with *args and **kwargs

Definition:

*args lets you pass multiple positional arguments.

**kwargs lets you pass multiple keyword arguments as a dictionary.
Example:

def add_numbers(*args, **kwargs):
    total = sum(args)
    print("Operation:", kwargs.get("operation", "Addition"))
    return total

result = add_numbers(10, 20, 30, operation="Sum of Numbers")
print("Result:", result)


âœ… Explanation: *args collects numbers into a tuple, **kwargs passes extra info like "operation".

1. Two Sum Problem

Definition: Given an array and a target, find indices of two numbers such that their sum equals the target.
Example:

def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        diff = target - num
        if diff in seen:
            return [seen[diff], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

print(two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0,1]


âœ… Explanation: We store numbers in a dictionary (seen) and check if the required difference exists.

2. Max / Min in Array

Definition: To find the largest and smallest elements in an array by iterating through it.
Example:

def find_max_min(arr):
    max_val = arr[0]
    min_val = arr[0]
    for num in arr:
        if num > max_val:
            max_val = num
        if num < min_val:
            min_val = num
    return max_val, min_val

print(find_max_min([3, 1, 7, 9, 2, 8]))


âœ… Explanation: Loop compares each element with the current max_val and min_val to update them.

ðŸ”¹ SQL
1. GROUP BY

Definition: Groups rows having the same values in a column and performs aggregation.
Example:

SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;


âœ… Explanation: Groups employees by department and calculates average salary per group.

2. COUNT

Definition: Counts the number of rows in a column or table.
Example:

SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;


âœ… Explanation: Returns total number of employees per department.

3. SUM

Definition: Adds up all values of a numeric column.
Example:

SELECT SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees;


âœ… Explanation: Returns the total salary paid to all employees in the company.
